			<strong>UTM Codes Or Parameters</strong></p>
		<p>
			<b>What is UTM Code or Parameter?</b></p>
		<p>
			UTM is an standing for Urchin Tracking Module and it's the format which Google uses to track URL's.</p>
		<p>
			UTM Parameters are simple small pieces of information that can be added to the end of any URL that gives Google information about that link. </p>
			<p>Example - https://www.mywebsite.com/?<b>utm_source=emailcampaign</b></p>
			<p>The part after the question mark is a UTM Parameter. When that link is clicked, Google Analytics for that particular website will read & record that parameter information.</p>
		<p>
			<b>UTM Parameters</b></p>
		<p>
			 5 UTM parameters that can be used for tracking diffrent pieces of information in Google Analytics</p>
		<p>
			1. (utm_source) Campaign Source 
			2. (utm_medium) Campaign Medium
			3. (utm_campaign) Campaign Name
			4. (utm_term) Campaign Term
			5. (utm_content) Campaign Content</p>
		<p>
			<b>Build Your Own Trackable URL</b></p>
		<p>

		<p>
			Another very essential advantage of hiring limos is that each one of your friends can easily fit in a limo party bus and that too very comfortably. This helps in avoiding anyone getting late while reaching the venue. This also helps in avoiding extra fuel costs of taking many vehicles as all are in just one bus. You can have quality time together while travelling as everyone is already onboard.</p>
		<p>
			5. Lesser Costs</p>
		<p>
			Renting a limo bus costs much lesser than travelling in your own vehicles as you can all contribute and pay the rent easily. This is really a great benefit.</p>
		<p>
			6. Business Party Venue</p>
		<p>
			Limo party buses work greatly for business parties as you can easily discuss anything with comfort and also don&#39;t have to worry about getting home safely after few drinks.</p>
